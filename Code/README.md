# Code instructions

The code is divided in 2 parts: the source code for the embedded controller (ESP32 S2 mini) and the code of the windows app that interfaces with MA3 (.net)

## ESP32 S2 mini

This part of the project is based on the ESP32 S2 mini micro controller.

The code is based on the Espressif VS Code extension. [Follow their instruction on how to install it](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/vscode-esp-idf-extension/en/latest/index.html).

## Windows App

The windows app is written in .net

I Use the JetBrains Ridder IDE to develop it (Free for non-commercial). Try it out yourself [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
