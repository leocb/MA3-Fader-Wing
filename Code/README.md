# Code instructions

The code is divided in 2 parts: the source code for the embedded controller (ESP32 S2 mini) and the code of the windows app that interfaces with MA3 (.net)

## ESP32 S2 mini

This part of the project is based on the ESP32 S2 mini micro controller.
The code is done via Arduino IDE

Quick How-to:

1. Install ESP32 boards by espressif
2. Select `ESP32S2 Dev Module` board
3. Reset the board into bootloader mode (Hold the `0` button and tap the `reset` button, release the `0` button)
4. Select the ESP comm port
5. Upload

## Windows App

The windows app is written in .net

I (will) Use the JetBrains Ridder IDE to develop it (Free for non-commercial). Try it out yourself [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
